  description: >
    I love working with JavaScript, Node, GraphQL, Typescript, and React. The whole JAMStack is my ... jam. I have made express node REST api backends, GraphQL services. Headless WordPress sites with custom plugins and custom post types. For a while I wrote custom PHP software. I have a couple of Swift for iOS tutorials on YouTube. I just love learning new things and getting good, nay - great.

    I have made websites on the side for a long time in 2018 I took the leap and I have been doing it full time.

    I hate saying the standard things like 'I'm a hard worker', and 'I follow through and follow up on projects'. You can't know that from words alone, you can only know that from working with someone. People know that from working with me. I take pride in the code I deliver because that's who I am. I'm not prideful about my code because ego kills growth and growth is what I want.
